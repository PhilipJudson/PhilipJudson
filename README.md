- 👋 Hi, I’m @PhilipJudson
- 👀 I’m interested in reasoning based prediction systems in chemistry.  I was a founder member of Lhasa Limited, the not-for-profit company that develops applications in chemistry and toxicology and was the creator of the first prototype for the widely used toxicity prediction system, 'Derek'.
- 💞️ I’m currently collaborating on the development of a system to create a pool of synthetically-accessible chemical structures.
